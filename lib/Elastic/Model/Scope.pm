=head1 NAME

Elastic::Model::Scope - Keeps objects alive and connected

=head1 VERSION

version 0.24

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Elastic::Model::Scope> is an optional in-memory cache, which serves three
purposes:

=over

=item *

Keep weak-ref L<Elastic::Doc> attributes alive

=item *

Reuse L<Elastic::Doc> objects as singletons.

=item *

Multiple scopes allow you to have multiple versions of L<Elastic::Doc> objects
live at the same time.

=back

See L<Elastic::Manual::Scoping> for a fuller discussion of when and how to use
scoping.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 parent

The parent scope of this scope, or UNDEF.

=head1 METHODS

The logic used in scopes is best explained by the examples below:

=head2 get_object()

    $obj = $scope->get_object($domain_name, $uid);

When calling L<Elastic::Model::Domain/"get()"> or L<Elastic::Model::Role::Model/"get_doc()">
to retrieve an object from ElasticSearch, we first check to see if we can
return the object from our in-memory cache by calling L</get_object()>:

=head3 Getting an object that exists in the current scope

If an object with the same C<namespace_name/type/id> exists in the CURRENT scope
(and its version is as least as high as the requested version, if any) then
we return the SAME object.

    $scope = $model->new_scope;
    $one   = $domain->get( user => 123 );
    $two   = $domain->get( user => 123 );

    print $one->name;
    # Clint

    $two->name('John');

    print $one->name;
    # John

    print refaddr($one) == refaddr($two) ? 'TRUE' : 'FALSE';
    # TRUE

=head3 Getting an object that exists in a parent scope

If an object with the same C<domain_name/type/id> exists in the PARENT scope
(and its version is as least as high as the requested version, if any) then
we return a CLONE of the object. (Note: we clone the original object as it was
when loaded from ElasticSearch. Any unsaved changes are ignored.)

    $scope_1 = $model->new_scope;
    $one     = $domain->get( user => 123 );

    print $one->name;
    # Clint

    $one->name('John');

    $scope_2 = $model->new_scope;
    $two     = $domain->get( user => 123 );

    print $two->name;
    # Clint

    print refaddr($one) == refaddr($two) ? 'TRUE' : 'FALSE';
    # FALSE

Otherwise the calling method will fetch the object from ElasticSearch itself,
and store it in the current scope.

=head3 Getting an object that has been deleted

If the object exists in the same scope or a parent scope, but it is
an L<Elastic::Model::Deleted> object, then we return C<undef>.

=head2 store_object()

    $object = $scope->store_object($ns_name, $object);

When we load a object that doesn't exist in the current scope or in any of
its parents, or we create-a-new or update-an-existing object via
L<Elastic::Model::Role::Doc/"save()">,
we also store it in the current scope via L</store_object()>.

    $scope_1 = $model->new_scope;
    $one     = $domain->get( user => 123 );

    print $one->name;
    # Clint

    $scope_2 = $model->new_scope;
    $two     = $domain->get( user => 123 );

    print $two->name;
    # Clint

    print refaddr($one) == refaddr($two) ? 'TRUE' : 'FALSE';
    # FALSE

=head3 Storing an object in a new scope

Now we update the C<$one> object, while B<< C<$scope_2> >> is current, and save it:

    $one->name('John');
    $one->save;

Object C<$one> is now in C<$scope_1> AND C<$scope_2>.

    $three   = $domain->get( user => 123 );

    print $three->name;
    # John

    print refaddr($one) == refaddr($three) ? 'TRUE' : 'FALSE';
    # TRUE

Object C<$two> still exists, and is still kept alive, but will no longer be
returned from C<$scope_2>.

    print $two->name;
    # Clint

=head2 delete_object()

    $scope->delete_object( $ns_name, $uid );

When calling L<Elastic::Model::Role::Model/delete_doc()>,
L<Elastic::Model::Domain/delete_doc()> or L<Elastic::Model::Role::Doc/delete()>
we check to see if an object with the same UID (C<namespace_name/type/id>)
exists in the current scope.

If it does, we rebless it into L<Elastic::Model::Deleted>. Otherwise, we
create a new L<Elastic::Model::Deleted> object with the C<$uid> and store
that in the current scope.

=head3 Deleting an object which exists in the current scope

    $scope_1 = $model->new_scope;
    $one     = $domain->get( user => 1 );

    $domain->delete (user => 1 );

    print $domain->isa('Elastic::Model::Deleted') ? 'TRUE' : 'FALSE';
    # TRUE

    print $one->name;                        # Throws an error,

=head3 Deleting an object which doesn't exist in the current scope

    $scope_1 = $model->new_scope;
    $one     = $domain->get( user => 1 );

    $scope_2 = $model->new_scope;

    $domain->delete( user => 1);

    $two     = $domain->get( user => 1 );    # Throws an error

    print $one->name;
    # Clint

    undef $scope_2;
    $two     = $domain->get( user => 1 );

    print refaddr($one) == refaddr($two) ? 'TRUE' : 'FALSE';
    # TRUE

But, calling L<delete()|Elastic::Model::Role::Doc/delete()> on an object
which isn't in the current scope still affects that object:

    $scope_1 = $model->new_scope;
    $one     = $domain->get( user => 1 );

    $scope_2 = $model->new_scope;

    $one->delete;

    print $one->name;                        # Throws an error
