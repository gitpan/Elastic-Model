When an object in scope is deleted, it is reblessed into
Elastic::Model::Deleted, which throws an error if any method other than
those listed below are called.

For instance:

    $user = $domain->get( user => 1 );
    $user->delete;
    print $user->name;
    # throws error

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 uid

    $uid = $deleted_doc->uid

The original UID of the deleted doc.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 has_been_deleted()

    1 == $deleted->has_been_deleted()

Returns true without checking ElasticSearch. This method is provided
so that it can be called in an L<Elastic::Model::Role::Doc/on_conflict>
handler.

Also see L<Elastic::Model::Role::Doc/has_been_deleted()>.
