0.13    2012-10-10
        BUG FIXES:
         - UIDs from search results were missing the routing value
         - use Elastic::Doc on 'extend'ed classes didn't work as expected
         - Minimum version of Moose set to 2.06

0.12    2012-09-22
        ENHANCEMENT:
         - Added support for retrieving partial objects (thanks to DIEGOK
           for suggesting)
         - Improved documentation (thanks to TIMB)

0.11    2012-08-18
        ENHANCEMENT:
         - Variable::Magic v 0.51 allows us to remove the magic after inflating
           a stub object - thanks to VPIT for the new version

0.10    2012-08-15
        BUG FIX:
         - Declare a minimum version for ElasticSearch::SearchBuilder

0.09    2012-08-14
        ENHANCEMENT:
         - Added terms_indexed_for_field() to Elastic::Model::Role::Doc to aid
           debugging.
         - Added id() and type() convenience methods on Elastic::Model::Role::Doc
           which call the equivalent method on the doc's UID

        BUG FIX:
         - Changed the mapping for UIDs to use the full path name, not
           'just_name'.  * REQUIRES REINDEXING *
            This fixes a major bug where all Doc class attributes in an object
            were being indexed in the same fields, so it was impossible to
            distinguish a search for (mother => $user) from (father => $user).
            Unfortunately, this means it is no longer possible to search for just
            any UID using queryb($uid), as it now needs the full path name for
            the attribute, eg queryb( 'user.partner' => $user ).
            Consequently, I've also had to change the Index->repoint_uids
            to search in all possible UID attributes.

0.08    2012-08-09
        ENHANCEMENT:
         - added a transform() parameter to reindex() to allow the user to
           change the data structure while reindexing
        BUG FIX:
         - don't try to destroy scopes during global shutdown
         - reindex() was loading all docs into memory, rather than processing
           them in blocks
0.07    2012-08-02
        ENHANCEMENT:
         - Added Elastic::Model::SearchBuilder to automatically serialize
           queries/filters like ->filterb( user => $user_doc )
           or ->filterb( $uid )
0.06    2012-08-02
        BUG:
         - The unique key was using the attribute name, rather than
           the unique key name.
0.05    2012-08-01
        ENHANCMENTS:
         - Added support for unique_keys via ElasticSearchX::UniqueKey
         - Added a Keyword type to be used for not_analyzed string fields
         - Handle stub doc inflation using Variable::Magic instead of
           wrapping _inline_instance_* in Moose
        BUG FIXES:
         - Lazy attributes weren't being built properly during deflation
0.04    2012-07-25
        overwrite() should work for new docs as well as docs loaded from ES
        on_conflict() called with $doc->create doesn't get a version number,
        so just load the existing doc

0.03    2012-07-08
        Skip parts of the test suite which require a live cluster to run
