        ENHANCEMENT:
         - added a transform() parameter to reindex() to allow the user to
           change the data structure while reindexing
        BUG FIX:
         - don't try to destroy scopes during global shutdown
         - reindex() was loading all docs into memory, rather than processing
           them in blocks

        overwrite() should work for new docs as well as docs loaded from ES
        on_conflict() called with $doc->create doesn't get a version number,
        so just load the existing doc
